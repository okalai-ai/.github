# 🌍 Okalai

**Description**  
Okalai is a research and development studio focused on high-integrity, interpretable, and equitable tools for African and multilingual NLP. We build datasets, evaluation metrics, and lightweight frameworks — with a special focus on underrepresented languages like Kwanyama, Ndonga, and other Bantu languages of Southern Africa.

Our goal: to make African NLP not just visible — but visionary.
